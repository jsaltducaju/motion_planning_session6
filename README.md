# motion_planning_session6
This repository has been created for the WASP Software Engineering Course. Its goal is solving Hand In exercise #6 for the ELLIIT Ph.D. Course on Motion Planning and Control (https://www.fs.isy.liu.se/Edu/Courses/MotionPlanning/).

The provided files compute the Dubins’ path for selected initial and final states and compares the results with the Dubins’ path computed by a Matlab pre-built Dubins' paths' library implementation.

A pdf file will be added in the following days summarizing the main results.
